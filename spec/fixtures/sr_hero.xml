                    <description>The Body attribute determines a character's resistance to outside forces. It represents the character's cardiovascular fitness and endurance, immune system, how well she heals, her tolerance for drugs and alcohol, and, to some extent, her muscle and bone structure and weight. Low Body could mean a character is skinny and frail-boned or has bad eating and health habits. High Body means a character is better fed, tough as nails, has strong bones with some spring to them, and an immune system that won't quit. Body does not necessarily correlate with physical size - a fat, out of shape character likely has a low Body, but a small character who is wiry and athletic may have a high Body.</description>

                    <description>Agility represents fine motor control - manual dexterity, flexibility, balance, and coordination. A character with a low Agility may be someone with an inner-ear problem, one leg that is shorter than the other, or a simple klutz. Higher Agility ratings may belong to characters that are "natural" athletes.</description>

                <attribute name="Reaction" text="4/6" base="4" modified="6" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="9" minimum="1" category="Physical">
                    <description>A character's Reaction is, quite simply, her physical reflexes - how quickly she can react to a changing situation, and how well she can dodge the physical slings and arrows that shadowrunning brings. A character with a high Reaction is more likely to be on top of a situation and will be in a better position to react to danger, while low-Reaction characters will lag behind.</description>

                <attribute name="Strength" text="3" base="3" modified="3" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="9" minimum="1" category="Physical">
                    <description>Strength denotes what a character's muscles can do, including things such as raw lifting power and running speed. Strength is somewhat dependent on a character's size and metatype. If your character is a 5'3" tall, 115-pound human girl, she's unlikely to possess an unaugmented Strength attribute of 6. On the other hand, dwarfs have a muscle density that rivals that of reptiles. Characters with low Strength may be small, skinny, or slight, or simply too busy to work out. A high- Strength character may be tough and wiry, know how to use her body to her best advantage, work out every day, or simply be fraggin' BIG.</description>

                <attribute name="Charisma" text="2" base="2" modified="2" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="9" minimum="1" category="Mental">
                    <description>Charisma is a nebulous attribute. More than just looks, Charisma represents a character's personal aura, self-image, ego, willingness to find out what people want and give it to them, and ability to recognize what she can and can't get out of people. A whiny demeanor, a me-first attitude, or an inability to read body language or subtle hints are just a few traits that can give a character low Charisma. A character with high Charisma might simply enjoy entertaining others, may excel at making friends and/or manipulating people, or may be all flash and fun with whomever it is today. A high-Charisma character might deliver jokes at the right moment, have a sexy way of carrying herself, or command respect because her timing is always impeccable.</description>

                    <description>Intuition covers "mental alertness" - the ability to take in and process information, to read a crowd, to assess a situation for danger or opportunity. A character with little Intuition may be unobservant, may rarely think things fully through, or could simply be "slow." A character with a high Intuition is adept at making the best of a bad situation, knowing when to leave before an encounter escalates, noticing small clues, and working from instinct.</description>

                <attribute name="Logic" text="2" base="2" modified="2" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="9" minimum="1" category="Mental">
                    <description>Logic represents a character's memorizing ability and raw brainpower. It denotes how fast a character learns, how much she can remember, and how well she can execute pre-planned sequences. A Logic-lacking character might get overwhelmed when confronted with a lot of details and may have a poor memory - especially for facts and figures. Characters with a high Logic rating will likely be excellent book-learners, able to deal with computer and magic theory with ease, and capable of building (and tearing down!) machinery and electronics.</description>

                <attribute name="Willpower" text="3" base="3" modified="3" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="9" minimum="1" category="Mental">
                    <description>Willpower keeps a character going when she wants to give up, or enables her to control her habits and emotions. Willpower determines whether or not a character is going to take charge of her life. A character with low Willpower might defer to other people when big decisions are being made, for example. A high-Willpower character is more assured and possesses a never-say-die streak. Such characters go down to the monowire because that's exactly the fragging point. Willpower also represents a character's cool under fire, her ability to resist intimidation and manipulation, and her resolve to stick to her guns when the pressure is on.</description>

                <attribute name="Edge" text="2" base="2" modified="2" naturalmaximum="7" augmentedmaximum="10" minimum="1" category="Special">
                    <description>A character's Edge represents that special something that can turn the tide and save the day - a successful gut check, a moment of brilliant inspiration or creativity, or a once-in-a-lifetime physical feat. Edge is a combination of luck, timing, and the favor of the gods. Characters with low Edge are unlikely to get unexpected breaks in life, much less win the lottery. A high-Edge character, however, is graced with good fortune and has an uncanny ability to succeed despite the odds. Edge can be spent at certain points in the game to help tip the odds in your character's favor. Unlike other attributes, Edge provides Edge points that may be spent in certain ways - once used, these points are not regained until certain in-game events occur, at the discretion of the gamemaster (see Edge, p. 74).</description>

                    <description>Essence is a measure of life force, of a body's wholeness. It represents the body's cohesiveness and holistic strength. Things that are invasive to the body, such as cyberware and bioware, reduce Essence. If a character abuses her body repeatedly with chemicals, toxins, or even just negligence over a long period of time, she may lose Essence as well. Long-time drug addicts and chipheads who have done permanent damage to their systems have lost Essence. Lost Essence can never be regained (short of the Essence Drain critter power). When Essence declines, Magic and Resonance decline by the same amount. All characters start the game with an Essence of 6.</description>

                    <description>A derived attribute, Initiative is the sum of Reaction and Intuition, plus any additional dice from implanted or magical reflex enhancers. As it sounds, Initiative is used to make Initiative Tests (p. 144), which determine the character's Initiative Score for a Combat Turn. Any enhancements to Reaction and Intuition also affect Initiative.</description>

                    <description>Some implants and magic may give a character extra actions to take in each Combat Turn. These are noted as extra Initiative Passes on the character's record sheet. The maximum number of Initiative Passes a character can have is 5, but most character types can only ever achieve 4.</description>

                            <description>While hardware that allows true multi-tasking is still out of reach, this frontal cortex and limbic system implant enhances the brain's ability to scan sensory input outside of the person's primary mental focus. This boosts the character's continuous partial attention - the overall awareness of several ongoing things at once, and the ability to shift concentration to what's most important without losing track of what's happening in the background. In game terms, the attention coprocessor adds its rating as a dice pool modifier to Perception Tests (note that it does not aid Astral or Matrix Perception Tests).</description>

                            <description>Move-by-wire-systems are the cutting- edge in motion control and reaction augmentation. They operate by putting the user's body in a constant state of seizure, so that it wishes to move in all directions simultaneously. An implanted expert system monitors the seizure and counteracts its effects until the user wishes to act. At that point, it channels the effects of the seizure along the desired path of motion, enabling the user to act with amazing speed and move with unnatural smoothness. The move-by-wire-system is based on similar systems used in aircraft, drone, and vehicle control and has proven to be highly effective - if sometimes debilitating to biological subjects. Move-by-wire users frequently suffer from slight, but uncontrollable, muscle tremors in certain muscle groups when they are at rest, mostly due to errors in the system's seizure compensation. The move-by-wire system confers a bonus of +2 to the character's Reaction attribute, +1 to the character's Dodge skill rating, and +1 Initiative Pass per point of rating. It also functions as skillwires (p. 335, SR4) at the following level: 

Move-by-Wire-Rating: Skillwire Rating
1: 2
2: 4
3: 5

Move-by-wire cannot be combined with any other form of Initiative enhancement except for reaction enhancers.</description>

                            <description>Similar to the bone lacing described on p. 333 of SR4, ceramic and kevlar bone lacing reinforce skeletal integrity. While ceramic bone lacing augments the bones with a sturdy, impact resistant poly-ceramic coating, kevlar bone lacing weaves a protective ballistic mesh around the individual's bones and joints. Ceramic bone lacing confers a +2 Body bonus for damage resistance tests and a +2 bonus to Impact armor. Kevlar bone lacing confers a +1 Body bonus for damage resistance tests and a +1 bonus to Ballistic armor. The bonuses of both types of bone lacing are cumulative with worn armor and cannot be detected by metal detectors. Characters with ceramic bone lacing inflict Physical damage with their unarmed blows, though kevlar bone lacing offers no such advantage.</description>

                            <description>In today's world of transplant-friendly bioware, the use of cyberlimbs is sometimes viewed as crude and outdated. On the other hand, they are cheap and easy to service and upgrade, so in the end they became even more popular for the less fortunate. Additionally, since cyberlimbs are capable of superior performance than natural ones and are compatible with a variety of specialized technologies, this kind of cyberware remains in high demand.

Cyberskulls and - torsos are included in this category, though they are in fact shells rather than full replacements.

When a particular limb is used for a test (such as leading an attack with your cyberarm), use the attribute for that limb (natural or cyber); in any other case, take the average value of all limbs involved in the task (round down). If a task requires the careful coordination of several limbs, use the value of the weakest limb. The attributes of partial limbs (including cyberhands and - feet) may be enhanced, but their attributes only apply for tests directly involving those limbs (such as a Strength Test when gripping something with an enhanced cyberhand). Cyberlimbs cannot hold any bioware, nor any cyber-implants that take up Essence rather than Capacity. Essence cost, Capacity, and other stats can be found on the Cyberlimb table (below).

Cyberlimbs have other useful features. They also grant the user 1 extra damage box to her Physical Condition Monitor for each cyberlimb she possesses. They have Capacity, allowing the integration of cyberweapons and other cyber accessories. They can perform at superhuman levels with the right enhancements. Finally, cyberlimbs can be dangerous even if they don't possess cyberweapons. Their Unarmed Damage Value is (STR ÷ 2)P.</description>

                                    <description>Cyber melee weapons are the classic toys of razorboys and gillettes. They are available as cyberlimb upgrades, but are also in heavy use as standalone systems implanted into the user's natural hands. The shock hand features shock pads built into the knuckles or palm of the hand - these inflict a nasty shock to anything they are in contact with when activated. Shock hands deal Electricity damage (p. 163) and have 10 charges (each); when plugged in they recharge at a rate of one charge per 10 seconds.</description>

                        <description>An attack of will may only be conducted with a physical or astral melee attack - willpower simply doesn't work with ranged attacks. Sometimes you are better off trying to smack a spirit with a gun than attempting to shoot it. While an attack of will can damage a spirit in spite of its formidable resilience to non-magical attack, only the truly courageous, driven, or mad have enough force of personality to affect a spirit.

When in melee with a spirit, a character may elect to make an attack of will rather than a normal melee strike. The character rolls his Banishing + Willpower (or just Willpower) as his dice pool, and his base Damage Value is (Charisma)P regardless of whether he is attacking with a spanner, combat axe, or his bare hands. Reach modifiers (attacker's or spirit's) do not apply to this test. The attack of will bypasses the spirit's Immunity to Normal Weapons and is otherwise resolved as a normal melee attack (see p. 156, SR4A). This form of attack is only effective against spirits.</description>

                                <description>The smartgun system connects a firearm or projectile weapon directly to a user's smartlink (p. 333). It incorporates a laser range finder and a small camera, and keeps track of ammunition, heat buildup, and material stress. It allows a smartlinked character to mentally switch between gun modes, eject clips, and fire the gun without pulling the trigger. The camera allows for targeted shooting around corners, without exposing oneself to return fire.

The system makes use of advanced calculation software, allowing the user to aim even weapons with a highly ballistic firing arc (like grenades) with tremendous precision over any distance. The smartgun system can also be accessed via wireless link, allowing for the gun to be remotely fired or to block the trigger (in case an opponent gets ahold of it). When used with a smartlink, it provides a +2 dice pool bonus on the ranged attack test.

Retrofitting a firearm with an internal Smartgun system doubles the weapon's price. An external smartgun system can be attached to the top mount or underbarrel mount with an Armorer + Logic (4, 1 hour) Extended Test. The small camera can be equipped with vision enhancements (p. 333).</description>

                                <description>Gas-vent recoil compensation systems vent a weapon's barrel gases at a specific vector to counter barrel climb. Gasvent systems can be built into machine pistols, SMGs, assault rifles, and machine guns. Installing them takes up the barrel mount and requires an Armorer + Logic (8, 1 hour) Extended Test; once installed, they cannot be removed. Weapons already equipped with a built-in gas-vent system cannot be equipped with an additional gas-vent system.

The gas-vent 2 system provides 2 points of recoil compensation; the gas-vent 3 system provides 3 points of recoil compensation.</description>

                                <description>The smartgun system connects a firearm or projectile weapon directly to a user's smartlink (p. 333). It incorporates a laser range finder and a small camera, and keeps track of ammunition, heat buildup, and material stress. It allows a smartlinked character to mentally switch between gun modes, eject clips, and fire the gun without pulling the trigger. The camera allows for targeted shooting around corners, without exposing oneself to return fire.

The system makes use of advanced calculation software, allowing the user to aim even weapons with a highly ballistic firing arc (like grenades) with tremendous precision over any distance. The smartgun system can also be accessed via wireless link, allowing for the gun to be remotely fired or to block the trigger (in case an opponent gets ahold of it). When used with a smartlink, it provides a +2 dice pool bonus on the ranged attack test.

Retrofitting a firearm with an internal Smartgun system doubles the weapon's price. An external smartgun system can be attached to the top mount or underbarrel mount with an Armorer + Logic (4, 1 hour) Extended Test. The small camera can be equipped with vision enhancements (p. 333).</description>

                        <description>This weapon does not detonate like a normal grenade, instead sending out a powerful electromagnetic pulse designed to create damaging current and voltage surges in electronic items. Th ough most electronics in 2070 are optical based, an EMP blast can still affect power supplies, anything linked to an antenna or electric cable, or older/cheaper devices with integrated circuits, transistors, inductors, or silicon chips. Most cyberware is also unaffected; RFID chips, however, are extremely vulnerable to EMP attacks.

The gamemaster determines what devices are affected. Each affected device within a 10-meter radius makes a Device Rating x 2 (3) Test; reduce the threshold by 1 for 2 meters outside of that radius. Items that fail the test burn out, have their data erased, and may even catch on fire or explode from the power surge. At the gamemaster's discretion, even optical devices like commlinks will lose 3 points of Signal rating as their antennae are affected.</description>

                        <description>Incendiary grenades do not explode, but instead start to burn, generating intense heat and spewing flames and burning sparks within a 10-meter radius. Anything flammable within this radius may catch on fire at the gamemaster's discretion (see Fire Damage, p. 155, SR4). Incendiary grenades will continue to spark and burn for 10 Combat Turns. The burning grenade and its sparks negate any visibility modifiers for darkness in a 30-meter radius, but also impose the Glare visibility modifier (see p. 140, SR4) to anyone looking in its direction (flare compensation eliminates the latter modifier). Anyone touching or moving within 1 meter of a burning incendiary grenade must resist a DV of 4P Fire Damage (see p. 155, SR4).</description>

                        <description>Cyber melee weapons are the classic toys of razorboys and gillettes. They are available as cyberlimb upgrades, but are also in heavy use as standalone systems implanted into the user's natural hands. The shock hand features shock pads built into the knuckles or palm of the hand - these inflict a nasty shock to anything they are in contact with when activated. Shock hands deal Electricity damage (p. 163) and have 10 charges (each); when plugged in they recharge at a rate of one charge per 10 seconds.</description>

                        <description>A full body suit with computer-designed environmental-pattern facsimiles. All have reversible day/night patterns.

When worn in an appropriate environment, the suit inflicts a -2 Perception Test dice pool modifier to spot the wearer (if worn in an inappropriate environment, it incurs a +2 bonus instead). Also armored for additional protection.</description>

                    <item name="Leviathan Technical Bulletproof kevlar bone lacing (Alphaware)" rating="1" useradded="no" quantity="1" rfid="Present" wireless="Present">
                        <description>Similar to the bone lacing described on p. 333 of SR4, ceramic and kevlar bone lacing reinforce skeletal integrity. While ceramic bone lacing augments the bones with a sturdy, impact resistant poly-ceramic coating, kevlar bone lacing weaves a protective ballistic mesh around the individual's bones and joints. Ceramic bone lacing confers a +2 Body bonus for damage resistance tests and a +2 bonus to Impact armor. Kevlar bone lacing confers a +1 Body bonus for damage resistance tests and a +1 bonus to Ballistic armor. The bonuses of both types of bone lacing are cumulative with worn armor and cannot be detected by metal detectors. Characters with ceramic bone lacing inflict Physical damage with their unarmed blows, though kevlar bone lacing offers no such advantage.</description>
